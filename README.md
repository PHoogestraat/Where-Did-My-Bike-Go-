# Can Bike theft be predicted?

Between 2018 and 2008,  almost 5 thousand bikes were stolen in Indianapolis according to public records (fig A). Additional data can be extracted to identify where and when bikes are taken in Marion county. After compling data from the 2018 to 2008 time period the following trends can be observed:

- The months May through September have a significantly higher rate of theft then colder months. 
- Bike theft reported is highest between 12:00 A.M. and 12 P.M 
- Consistent peak around 7:00 P.M.
- These trends are consisitent regardless of month or year. 

Can this information coupled with weather data may enable the ability to identify areas of  Indianapolis that have a higher risk for theft.
